\section{Pressure}

\subsection{Automatic Flushing Tank}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To identify the application of pressure differences}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
The effect of pressure in a liquid can be observed in different ways. Automatic flushing tanks operate under the influence of pressure in a liquid. When the level of water in a container reaches the highest point in the exit pipe, water will drain from the tank until the level of the water in the tank is below the level of the outlet. The tank can then be refilled to repeat the cycle. This type of system is useful for flushing or when you need a certain amount of water for a given amount of time.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Empty drinking water bottle, straw, water, bucket, chewing gum OR superglue

\label{fig:auto-flushing-tank}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
Cut off the top of an empty water bottle, make a hole at the bottom so as to fit the straw through it. 
Bend the straw inside the bottle so that it makes an upside down 'U' shape. Use the chewing gum or superglue to seal the hole.

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Hold the bottle and place the bucket below the bottle.} 
\item{Pour some water into the bottle up to and above the bend in the straw and observe what happens.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusions}
The water will flow into the bucket through the bent straw. 

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later.

\subsubsection*{Discussion Question}
What causes the water to flow from the bottle to the bucket? How does this work?

\subsubsection*{Notes}
The siphon principle states that liquid is able to flow without pumping because the combined pressure of the water and the atmosphere pushing down on the water is greater then the air pushing up on the straw. The automatic flushing tank does not require a handle to trigger the flush. Once the water flows into the tank up to the level of the siphon, the tank will flush automatically. 


\subsection{Cartesian Diver}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To observe characteristics of a submerging body}
\item{To describe and apply the concept of Cartesian diver in daily life}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
When the body is immersed in a liquid it may sink or float. The body will float in water when its density is less than density of water. A submerging body is designed in such a way that it will sink a little but also float in water. 

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Large Bottle (1.5 litres) or transparent long container with a cover or cap, water, syringe, and small stones

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
Remove the needle from the syringe.

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Fill a bottle with some water.}
\item{Remove the plunger from the syringe and insert a few stones into the syringe.}
\item{Replace the plunger so that the syringe is full of air but sealed at the top.} 
\item{Hold the syringe upright and immerse it in the bottle making sure that the syringe and its contents float upright in the water.}
\item{Close the bottle with the cap.}
\item{Gently squeeze the bottle near the bottom.} 
\item{Observe what happens.}
\end{enumerate}

\caption{The Cartesian Diver}
\label{fig:cartesian-diver}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusions}
When the bottle is gently squeezed the syringe sinks down to the bottom. When the bottle is released the syringe rises back up. 

\subsubsection*{Discussion Question}
Why does the syringe move down when the bottle is squeezed?

\subsubsection*{Notes}
The syringe sinks down because the pressure in the bottle increases when you squeeze it. Added pressure will cause water from the bottle to enter into the syringe through the needle hole. This increases the weight of the syringe and thus it sinks. When the pressure is released, the water in the syringe leaves and so the syringe will float again. A Cartesian diver and a submarine use the same principle to sink and float in deep water.


\subsection{A Siphon}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To demonstrate how to shift water from one bucket to another bucket using suction} 
\item{To identify the applications of atmospheric pressure} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Two buckets, water, thick rubber tube about 1 m long

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Pour some water into a bucket and place it on the table. Place the other bucket below the table.} 
\item{Put the rubber tube in the bucket and fill it with water.} 
\item{Bend one end of the tube so that air cannot enter and remove it from the bucket. Make sure the other end of the tube remains underwater.}
\item{Lower the bent end of the tube into the lower bucket.}
\item{Open the bent end. Observe what happens.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusions}
Water will flow from the bucket on the table to the other bucket below the table. This is because of the combined force of atmospheric pressure pushing in the top bucket and gravity pulling the water to the bottom bucket.

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later.

\subsubsection*{Discussion Question}
If the two buckets were switched, would the water flow from the lower bucket to a bucket on the table? Explain your answer.

\subsubsection*{Notes}
The flow of water is driven by the net difference in elevation of the two ends of the tube. The force of gravity pulls the water through a siphon. As long as the inlet is above the outlet, water will flow even if it has to go up before it goes down. This is because as water is pulled down the of the tube by gravity the pressure decreases at the top of the siphon and air pressure in the bucket pushes the water into the tube. This will continue until the water level in the top bucket is below the inlet of the tube.

\subsection{Liquid Pressure and Depth}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To verify the variation of pressure with depth in water} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
The wall of a dam is made much thicker at the bottom than at the top. Also, water storage tanks are placed at the top of a building. This is because the pressure in a liquid is related to its depth.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Plastic bottle, nail or metal pin/needle, matches, water


\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Light a match and heat the sharp point of the nail or pin.} 
\item{Use the heated nail to put three holes into a bottle. Put one hole near the bottom, one near the middle, and the last hole between them.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Fill the bottle with water up to the rim.} 
\item{Hold the bottle in air using your hand or place the bottle at the top of a tall object like a stool on a table.} 
\item{Allow water to flow out of the bottle and observe the trajectory of water from each hole. Note the horizontal distance reached of water from each hole.} 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

\input{./img/pressure-liquid.pdf_tex}
\caption{Demonstration of the effect of depth on liquid pressure}
\label{fig:pressure-liquid}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusions}
The water flows faster from the hole with the greater depth because there is greater pressure, showing that the water pressure increases with the depth of the water. This is because the weight of the water on top acts downward causing pressure. The greater the depth, the greater the weight, resulting in greater pressure. 

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later.

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{What have you observed in the trajectory of water from each hole?}
\item{How does the pressure change with the depth of water? Why?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
There is a difference between depth and height. Height is measured from the reference point upward while depth is measured from the reference point downward. The reference point in this case is at the surface of water. 
%The holes must not be in the same vertical line in order to view the flow clearly. 

\subsection{Making a Magdeburg Hemisphere}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To demonstrate the effect of atmospheric pressure} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Two small cooking pots of equal size, oil, matches, small pieces of paper

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
Spread oil or grease around the edge of one of the cooking pots.

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Place some pieces of paper into the cooking pot which does not have any oil.} 
\item{Light the pieces of paper on fire.} 
\item{Allow the paper to burn until about half of it has burned.} 
\item{Place the greased cooking pot upside-down on top of the ungreased cooking pot so that they create a sort of ball and no air can escape.} 
\item{Allow the pots to cool.} 
\item{Try to separate the pots.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusions}
After the pots have cooled it is very difficult to separate them. This is because when you burn the paper, the air in the pot expands and escapes. When you cover the pots, no more air can enter and the air inside cools, reducing the pressure inside the pots while the pressure outside the pots remains the same. The atmospheric pressure therefore presses the pots together so as to equalize the pressure on either side of the pot. 



\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later.

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{What is the reason for burning the paper and then covering the pot?}
\item{What happens when the pots cool?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
The principle behind the Magdeburg hemisphere is used to create suction. When air is heated, it expands and escapes. If the hot container is sealed and allowed to cool, the reduced number of particles causes a lower pressure than atmospherric pressure. Thus, the force pushing the two pots together from the outside is greater than the force pushing out from the inside and thus the two pots are very difficult to separate. 


\subsection{Air Pressure}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To observe the effects of air pressure on a flexible material}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
Air in a container pushes out with equal force on all sides of the container. If the pressure in the container is low, the force is small; if the pressure is high, the force is large. If the pressure is high, it is difficult to bend or crush the container as the air pressure inside resists being pushed. If the pressure is high enough, it can cause a flexible container to be rigid.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Plastic straw, potato

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Hold a straw and push it hard into the potato.}
\item{Observe what happens to the straw.}
\item{Place your thumb firmly over one end of a straw and push the other end into the potato.}
\item{Observe what happens to the straw and potato.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Cleanup Procedure}
Dispose of the potato and return the straw to its proper place.

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Why does the straw not pierce the potato when your thumb is not blocking the back of the straw?}
\item{Why does the straw pierce the potato when your thumb is blocking the potato?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusions}
When the straw is pushed into the potato, it bends. The skin of the potato is strong enough that the straw cannot pass through it. However, when your thumb covers the back of the straw, the straw breaks the skin of the potato and passes through. This is because the air in the straw pushes out against the sides of the straw. Without your thumb, the air can simply escape out the back of the straw without applying a force. When your thumb covers the hole, the air cannot go anywhere so it applies a force outward. This causes the side of the straw to become rigid, allowing it to break the skin of the potato.

\subsubsection*{Notes}
Be sure that, in the first step, you are not holding your thumb over the back of the straw. This should only be done later.

\subsection{The Effect of Surface Area on Pressure}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To observe the factors affecting pressure} 
\item{To demonstrate the effects of surface area on pressure} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
When a force acts on an object, the results are greatly affected by the area over which it acts. Consider the pain in your hand when you carry a bucket of water with a thin wire handle. Wrapping a piece of fabric around the handle greatly reduces the pain. This can be explained using pressure and summarized in the equation:
$$\mathrm{Pressure} = \mathrm{Force} \times \mathrm{Area}$$
$$P=F\times A$$

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Bar of soap, thin thread, thick string, 4 heavy stones of approximately equal weight, two stools, and a small wooden board.

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Place the wooden board between the two stools.}
\item{Place the piece of soap on top of the wooden board. }
\item{Tie stones to the ends of the thick string. Then tie stones to the end of the thin thread.} 
\item{Hang each type of thread across the bar of soap so that the stones hang freely.} 
\item{Observe the effect of each thread on the bar of soap.} 
\end{enumerate}

\input{./img/pressure-solid2.pdf_tex}
\caption{Thick String}
\label{fig:pressure-solid2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusions}
It will be seen that the bar of soap was cut easily by using a thin thread but not by using a thick string. This because the thin thread has a small surface area and the same force and therefore a large pressure, while the thick thread has a larger area for the same force and therefore smaller pressure. 

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later.

\subsubsection*{Discussion Question}
Why does a thin thread cut easily through a bar of soap while a thick thread does not?
